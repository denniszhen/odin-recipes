    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is how to make a california roll with brown rice. Enjoy.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients you'll need:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups brown rice, cooked</li>
        <li>Â¼ cup seasoned rice vinegar</li>
        <li>4 half sheets sushi grade nori</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sesame seed, optional</li>
        <li>8 pieces imitation crab</li>
        <li>1 small cucumber, cut into matchsticks</li>
        <li>1 avocado, thinly sliced</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>On a rolling mat, place one sheet of nori with the rough side facing upwards.</li>
        <li>Wet your hands and grab a handful of rice and place it on the nori. Spread the rice evenly throughout the nori without mashing the rice down. Season rice with a pinch of sesame seeds, if using, then flip it over so the nori is facing upwards.
        </li>
        <li>Arrange, in a horizontal row 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the bottom, the crab followed by a row of avocado and a row of cucumber.</li>
        <li>Grabbing both nori and the mat, roll the mat over the filling so the extra space at the bottom touches the other side, squeezing down to make a nice tight roll. Squeeze down along the way to keep the roll from holding its shape.</li>
        <li>Transfer the roll onto a cutting board. Rub a knife on a damp paper towel before slicing the roll into six equal portions.</li>
    </ol>
